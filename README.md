# Expo CLI: Resolving 'Command Failed' Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered with the Expo CLI: the dreaded 'Command failed' error.  These errors often stem from dependency conflicts or problems with the underlying React Native environment.  The example shows a problematic setup, and the solution provides steps to resolve these conflicts.

## Reproducing the Issue (expoBug.js)

The `expoBug.js` file contains a simplified representation of a project where the problem might manifest.  You would typically encounter this situation after installing multiple packages, possibly with overlapping dependencies or incorrect version combinations.

## Solution (expoBugSolution.js)

The `expoBugSolution.js` file demonstrates the recommended steps to fix this common Expo CLI error.  The key is to carefully manage dependencies and ensure they are compatible. Often, the steps are:

1. **Clean the project cache**: Remove temporary files that could be causing conflicts.
2. **Update dependencies**: Ensure that all packages are up-to-date and compatible with the current Expo SDK version.
3. **Reinstall native modules**: This can address problems with native dependencies that might have become corrupted.
4. **Check package.json for conflicting versions**: Manually inspect your `package.json` file for potentially conflicting dependencies. If needed, use resolutions to override specific versions. 
5. **Verify correct Expo SDK version**: Ensure that your Expo SDK is compatible with your React Native and other package versions.
