The solution often involves a multi-step approach:

1. **Clean the cache:**
```bash
expo start --clear
```
2. **Update dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
3. **Check and resolve conflicts in package.json:** Carefully examine the dependencies.  If you see conflicts, use npm's resolution to specify which versions should be used.  For example:
```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "react-native": "^0.71.8"
  }
}
```
4. **Reinstall native modules (if necessary):** In some cases, reinstalling native modules can resolve this issue, but this is usually needed only if you've recently made changes to the native parts of your app or if the error mentions specific native dependencies.  This step usually involves commands like:
```bash
expo prebuild
expo run:android  or expo run:ios
```
5. **Verify Expo SDK version compatibility:**   Make sure that your Expo SDK version and React Native version are compatible.  Check Expo's documentation for the latest version information.  If necessary upgrade your Expo SDK version.
By following these steps, you should resolve most 'Command failed' errors in Expo CLI.
